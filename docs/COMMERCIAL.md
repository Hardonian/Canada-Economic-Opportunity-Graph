# Commercialization & Monetization Architecture

CanadaOpportunityGraph maintains a clean separation between the open-source platform / CEGS standard and optional commercial intelligence layers.

> Implementation boundary: the checked-in reference product currently ships
> the public intelligence console, same-origin API gateway, operational control
> plane, persistent single-writer runtime, SDKs, exports, and deployment stack.
> The account, billing, paid quota, private workspace, watchlist, and outbound
> notification rows below describe the commercial extension architecture; they
> are not presented as active services until identity, tenancy, and a billing
> provider are explicitly configured.

## 1. The Open Standard Flywheel

```text
Open Standard (CEGS) ──► More Compatible Public Data ──► More Contributors & Adapters
                                                                   │
                                                                   ▼
Commercial Value ◄── Deeper Historical Graph ◄── Better OpportunityGraph Platform
```

The standard itself is free public infrastructure. The commercial moat is built upon:

1. **High-Frequency Ingestion**: Real-time polling of hundreds of municipal and regulatory gazettes.
2. **Proprietary Historical Depth**: Longitudinal event ledgers and backtested delay patterns.
3. **Automated Supplier Matching**: Deep capability profile matching against downstream opportunity graphs.
4. **Private Workspaces & Watchlists**: Tenant-isolated diligence notes, custom alert webhooks, and team collaboration.
